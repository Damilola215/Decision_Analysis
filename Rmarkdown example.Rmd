```

## R Markdown

Hello, This is an example 

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(readr)
participants_data <- read.csv("participants_data.csv")
#look at data
summary(participants_data)
library(tidyverse)
```

```


```{r cars, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```





Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
